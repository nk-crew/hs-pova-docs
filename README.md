To edit your theme settings, you'll first need to [create a page with a theme template](https://knowledge.hubspot.com/website-pages/edit-content-in-pages-using-a-website-theme#create-a-new-page). The theme settings can be accessed within the `page editor` by clicking the `Design` tab on the left. Then click `Edit theme settings`.
